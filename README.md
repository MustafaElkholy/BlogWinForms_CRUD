Build a Blog Windows form application with register and login forms. Make the user add his news and there's option to views all news by its catalog.
I used Entity Framework Core with Code First Approach to build my applicatoin.
The user register to the appliacation and start enter his news in the blog with all its data. then he can navigate with all news based on its catalog or add, edit and delete his news.
